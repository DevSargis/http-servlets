So we already know that we can create Owner Server but we dont know how we must return something body or header from our server, Let create On Server as Apache and following how it is work

1 Let create our Server and called it HttpServer, we now that we should use ServerSocket class for create Our server, and we must pass to it PORT
So we create HttpServer class which is our server, and there is one property PORT, which contain our server, we initialize that in our constructor then we create run method which will start our
Server, so at the time we must handle exception
In the run method we create serverSocket and pass to it port, than we accept that socket, in general accept method close all process, it take one thread and wait when we will accept client request
then when we already receive client request we must process that request, we create processSocket method and pass to it our accepted socket, and we create try with resources and first we pass to
it our socket because we must close our session after process request, and we create new DataInputStream object for our input data, it need for us for readable byte process, and that same way
we create outputStream for response.......Next we must handle request, actually request handle it is vary long and difficult process, we must know autorization, type processing that we can handle
request, but in general first we must analyze our request and based on that we must create our response, at the moment we just will print our request
in the next step we must create response for our Client, as we already said our response also must contain headers and body, for body we use test html file, and will create headers,
we know that in the response header first line we must have http version, and response status, then we add some headers there, after that we and body and headers we add in our outputStream
also we must have one separated line between header and body we can add it and our header section, or we can ose System.lineSeparator for go to next line, and finish our simple http server
already ready let create runner for our server and run that server
Then we create httpClient and use there HttpClient class for create client and use HttpRequest for create http request, then we send that request to localhost:9000 becouse our server in our machine
and work on 9000 port then we must run server for that we create HttpServerRunner and first run our server then we send there request, BUT AS WE ALREADY SAID OUR SERVER CAN TO SERVE ONLY ONE REQUEST
OTHER REQUEST WILL WAIT WHEN OUR REQUEST WILL COMPLETED,


Because our server can accepted for example 100 request at the moment we must become our server async, for that first we must declare ExecutorService, and create fixed thread pool, now we must
move that logic to the while loop Because we can keep our server turn on state and that it, and in the client side we must replace send to sendAsync, that is way work apache server in based
