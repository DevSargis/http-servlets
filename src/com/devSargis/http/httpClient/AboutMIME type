So we already know how http request is structured, now let's tolk about body, we can send request to server and our body can be any type for example <xml>, JSON and etc.
So we already know about header, and we know that header contain metadata about request or response, in the header we have two keys which describe which data type we send to server and
which data type server send us

headers
content-type: MIME type // This key response to which data type we sent to server
accept: MIME type // This key response to which data type server return us


MIME it is standard that indicates the nature and format of a document, file, or assortment of bytes
